# import statements for python, torch and companion libraries and your own modules
# TIP: use the python standard json module to write python dictionaries as JSON files

# global variables defining inference hyper-parameters among other things
# DON'T forget the multi-label classification probability threshold

# data, trained model and output directories/filenames initialization

# device initialization

# instantiation of transforms, dataset and data loader

# load network model from saved file

# initialize output dictionary

# prediction loop over test_loader
#    get mini-batch
#    compute network output
#    threshold network output
#    update dictionary entries write corresponding class indices

# write JSON file
